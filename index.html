      <h3>Robert Moore</h3>
      <p>Lead programmer for my high school <a href='https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc'>FIRST robotics</a>
        team, <a href='https://www.chelsearobotics.org/'>team 1502</a>.
        There I undertook projects such as <a
          href='https://github.com/frcteam1502/vscode-workspace-2019/blob/master/src/main/java/org/usfirst/frc/team1502/robot/commands/GuidedDrivingCommands.java'>machine
          vision</a>, autonomous driving, and teaching new programmers. I have been programming for <span
          id='years-experience'>5</span> years. When I'm not in school or robotics, I often work on pet programming
        projects in my spare time. My favorite technologies currently are Node, React, Next.js, and Git.
        I'm always trying to learn the latest and greatest technologies and techniques and integrate
        them into my projects, such as GraphQL, service workers, serverless functions, or React hooks.</p>

            <h4>Fit Society</h4>
            <p>Since I'm working on this one for a client, I'm going to say as little as possible even though I'm not
              technically under a NDA. What matters to you, the one I'm sending this résumé to, is that in this project
              I plan on using Heroku, React, Node, and pretty much the same technologies I used in Ginger except I plan
              on using REST APIs instead of GraphQL due to its poor compatiblility and DX with TypeScript.</p>

            <h4>Ginger</h4>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to learn React, Redux, test-driven development and GraphQL. I have
              learned React and Redux to a good degree of understanding but not the latter two. This project will be
              an offline-enabled recipe manager web app that can store your recipes, download others' recipes, share
              recipes, and browse popular recipes.</p>

            <h4>BitterBird</h4>
            <p>BitterBird analyzes a Twitter user by looking at their last 200 tweets. It graphs data like the number
              of tweets they post each month, how many likes and retweets each post gets, their favorite hashtags,
              most mentioned people, and most retweeted people. It also calculates their average sentiment
              (cheerleading teams often have very positive scores while politicians have more neutral or negative
              scores) and their writing grade level using the <a

                target='_blank'>Flesch-Kincaid</a> formula. BitterBird uses Node & Express, Vue, TypeScript, and
              Heroku.</p>

            <h4>Bukkit Magic Plugin</h4>
            <p>I like playing games as much as the next person, but after playing lots of plain Minecraft with friends
              I felt I wanted to add something new to the game. Hence, this project was created. Bukkit Magic Plugin,
              created with Java and the <a href='https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Main_Page'>Bukkit</a> framework adds
              over <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LxZNiKPuZXgdZUx3fcIo8uUideyNZvQm8BpPrLNUUV0'
                target='_blank'>50 magical items</a> to the game and offers a command to set up a "Hunger Games" style
              game, automating out of much of the setting-up process for each game, including creating a new world,
              placing players randomly, and giving players basic items.</p>

            <h4>Autonomous Camp</h4>
            <p>A program I made for the Bentley Robo-Raptors' robot at Kettering University during a summer
              camp. The robot was typically able to, when using sensors, get to within 2 inches of accuracy
              distance-wise and 1 degree
              of accuracy angle-wise. The camp had a competition for the robots to see who could get the most points
              in different ways
              (e.g., scoring a ball into a hole) and this program won with a score of more than double the score of
              the second place
              winner.</p>

            <h4>Participate</h4>
            <p>This frontend-only project solves a real-world classroom problem: teachers often give students
              participation points when they contribute something to the class. However, they currently keep track of
              participation on paper, which is wasteful and inconvenient. Enter Participate, the student
              participation tracker. Once teachers have entered their students' names into the program, it will tell
              them how many participation points everyone has gotten, and puts students who haven't been called on
              recently at the top of the list.</p>

            <h4>Examlet</h4>
            <p>Examlet allows students and teachers from the same G Suite domain to create and take exams. Students
              add the teachers that they need to take exams from, and teachers create exams and can view students'
              results. Exams are all graded automatically and feature cheating detection by showing teachers when
              students have been switching tabs or apps. Unfortunately, I never got around to finishing the exam
              statistics part of the webpage and so I left it as what I considered a minimum viable product.</p>

        <h3>Programmer for Chelsea High School</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Made a page containing Google Forms for signing into and out of the counseling office. This was used on
            a school iPad as a kiosk by the counseling office.</li>
          <li>Made a widget with help from a programmer from my robotics team that is essentially an interactive
            manifestation of their <a href='https://www.chelsea.k12.mi.us/about-us/mission-vision'
              target='_blank'>Portrait of a Graduate</a>. It contains clickable parts of the image which scroll to
            different parts of a PDF they provided us. Their goal was to create something similar to the <a

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>Currently I am a student at Chelsea High School, and I will graduate in 2021. I have a 4.0 unweighted GPA and
        took AP computer science in May 2019, receiving a 5 on the exam. I haven't decided which college I will
        continue my education at, but I am mainly looking at <a href='https://www.kettering.edu/'
          target='_blank'>Kettering</a> and <a href='https://umich.edu/' target='_blank'>University of Michigan</a>.
