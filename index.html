        <h3>Robert Moore</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a student at the University of Michigan pursuing a computer
          science major and intending to graduate in 2025. I have been
          programming for <span id="years-experience">7</span> years. When I'm
          not busy with schoolwork, I compose music, play online chess, or work
          on personal programming projects in my spare time. My favorite
          technologies currently are Node, React, Next.js, and Git, but I'm
          willing to learn anything. I'm always trying to learn the latest and
          greatest technologies and techniques and integrate them into my work.

              <p>
                Cadence uses AI to complete chord progressions based on existing
                music. It is a progressive web app and all data is stored
                locally. It was built with desktop power users in mind, with
                useful keyboard shortcuts on top of good general keyboard
                accessibility, but also features a unique chord entry keyboard
                for mobile users. It was built with SolidJS, my new favorite for
                client-side-rendered projects. Its ML is powered by
                Tensorflow.js.

                Since I'm working on this one for a client, I'm going to say as
                little as possible even though I'm not technically under a NDA.
                What I can say, regarding technology, is that in this project I
                am using Next.js and a slew of technologies that mesh well with
                it such as React, Node, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, TypeORM.

                The purpose of this project is to learn React, Redux,
                test-driven development and GraphQL. I have learned React and
                Redux to a good degree of understanding but not the latter two.
                This project is an offline-enabled recipe manager web app that
                allows you to create, share, download, browse, and rate recipes.

                BitterBird analyzes a Twitter user by looking at their last 200
                tweets. It graphs data like the number of tweets they post each
                month, how many likes and retweets each post gets, their
                favorite hashtags, most mentioned people, and most retweeted
                people. It also calculates their average sentiment (cheerleading
                teams often have very positive scores while politicians have
                more neutral or negative scores) and their writing grade level
                using the

                I like playing games as much as the next person, but after
                playing lots of plain Minecraft with friends I felt I wanted to
                add something new to the game. Hence, this project was created.
                Bukkit Magic Plugin, created with Java and the

                each game, including creating a new world, placing players
                randomly, and giving players basic items.

              <p>
                A program I made for the Bentley Robo-Raptors' robot at
                Kettering University during a summer camp. The robot was
                typically able to, when using sensors, get to within 2 inches of
                accuracy distance-wise and 1 degree of accuracy angle-wise. The
                camp had a competition for the robots to see who could get the
                most points in different ways (e.g., scoring a ball into a hole)
                and this program won with a score of more than double the score
                of the second place winner.

              <p>
                This frontend-only project solves a real-world classroom
                problem: teachers often give students participation points when
                they contribute something to the class. However, they currently
                keep track of participation on paper, which is wasteful and
                inconvenient. Enter Participate, the student participation
                tracker. Once teachers have entered their students' names into
                the program, it will tell them how many participation points
                everyone has gotten, and puts students who haven't been called
                on recently at the top of the list.

              <h4>Examlet</h4>
              <p>
                Examlet allows students and teachers from the same G Suite
                domain to create and take exams. Students add the teachers that
                they need to take exams from, and teachers create exams and can
                view students' results. Exams are all graded automatically and
                feature cheating detection by showing teachers when students
                have been switching tabs or apps. Unfortunately, I never got
                around to finishing the exam statistics part of the webpage and
                so I left it as what I considered a minimum viable product.

            <li>
              Modernized the pizza tracker 3 ways, each using a different
              client-side framework
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tried React with Next.js, Svelte with SvelteKit, and Preact
                  with Astro
                </li>
                <li>
                  We thought modernizing the tracker would make it easier to
                  make modifications later
                </li>
