      <h1>Week 9: Old King/Queen Theme</h1>
      <p>
        All I managed this week was the Old King/Queen's theme.
        Athena created the theme which I layered brass and bells over, and Vincencus created a nice MIDI mock-up of it, so I have them to thank for making this possible.
        This took me about 3 hours in total.
        Despite my rush, I think this turned out better than I imagined.
        I also really liked Vincencus' version of the theme, for the Mediterranean faction.

      <h2>Meetings</h2>
      <p>
        One meeting was cancelled, and I did not make it to the other one because I had to rush an EECS project, so I spent no time on meetings.
        I spent minimal time conversing with the team over Discord.
