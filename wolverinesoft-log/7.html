      <h1>Week 7: Main Theme Finished, Archmage Attack, Meetings</h1>
      <h2>Main Theme</h2>
      <p>
        I finally completed the main theme.
        Most importantly, I added in one last section for the Mediterranean faction, and made it loopable.
        I also touched up the first section by varying which instruments were responsible for carrying the melody.
        I changed the second section by giving the melody to a flute in a lower register in order to smooth the transition to the 3rd section.
        This took me about 5 hours in total.

      <h2>Archmage Attack</h2>
      <p>
        The original wizard attack sounds from last week seemed a little too dramatic, so I turned those into the archmage attack sounds. 
        Then, I made these versions for the normal wizard, which are toned down.
        This took me about 30 minutes.

      <h2>Meetings</h2>
      <p>I attended both WolverineSoft meetings this week, which were longer than usual as we were recording voice lines.
      I spent about 3 hours in each meeting, and the audio team skipped the squad meetings to get straight to recording.
      We also had a 1-hour meeting with a mentor, Gibson, who was previously on the WolverineSoft team. He gave us feedback
      on our work and playtested the game to let us know how our audio fit in the context of the game. One of his most
      useful recommendations was to make fewer good sound effects rather than many mediocre ones.
