      <h1>Week 5: Continuing the Main Theme</h1>
      <h2>Main Theme</h2>
      <p>
	I made significant progress on, but did not finish, the main theme.
	As I mentioned in last week's blog post, I wanted to pick a couple distinctive instruments for each faction, and dedicate a short section to it.
	This sprint I finished the Asian-themed faction, characterized by the koto and whistle.
	This took me about 7 hours for this short section.
	I also started on the Mediterranean section but haven't gotten anything I'm happy with yet.
	I've spent about 4 hours on that, though the progress hasn't been much.
	I think I have a melody I like (which you can hear half of in the audio file), but getting the transition from the previous section right has proved to be very tricky, as I want to give the last phrase from that section some space before starting the next one but without totally dissipating all energy.
	I did want to decrease the energy level in this section a little bit, but I think I've decreased it way too much the way it is now.

      <h2>Meetings</h2>
      <p>I attended both WolverineSoft meetings this week.
      I spent about 2 hours in the first one, and 3 in the second. 
      In the meetings we discussed narrative and drafted some potential voice lines.
      I also played a bit of Wargroove in the second meeting to further look at ways the music fits in the game (and for fun :)).
