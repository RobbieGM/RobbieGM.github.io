      <h1>Week 5: Continuing the Main Theme</h1>
      <h2>Main Theme</h2>
      <p>
        This is where I spent most of my time; probably the better part of 2 days but I'll conservatively estimate 10 hours.
        I wasn't even officially assigned this, but I did it because I wanted to have a main theme in the style of Wargroove's main theme.
        Wargroove's main theme starts out with an independent main theme and then incorporates themes from every faction.
        I wanted to do the exact same thing.
        What I have so far is an independent main theme, and a transition section to the theme that will belong to the Asian-themed faction.
        For this I'm planning to use a koto and whistle to help give it a distinct sound.
        These two instruments can already be heard in the below file.
        The other two factions I'll need themes are are a Mediterranean-themed faction and a European-themed faction.
        I'm thinking of using an oud/bouzouki and tablas for the Mediterranean faction, if I can find samples for that, and probably switch key to something <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=th0LBiIRQbA&si=uuKwsOgPPgvOGpVI&t=54">like this</a>.
        For the European-themed faction I think just putting brass instruments front and center should be plenty.

	I made significant progress on, but did not finish, the main theme.
	As I mentioned in last week's blog post, I wanted to pick a couple distinctive instruments for each faction, and dedicate a short section to it.
	This sprint I finished the Asian-themed faction, characterized by the koto and whistle.
	This took me about 7 hours for this short section.
	I also started on the Mediterranean section but haven't gotten anything I'm happy with yet.
	I've spent about 4 hours on that, though the progress hasn't been much.
	I think I have a melody I like (which you can hear half of in the audio file), but getting the transition from the previous section right has proved to be very tricky, as I want to give the last phrase from that section some space before starting the next one but without totally dissipating all energy.
	I did want to decrease the energy level in this section a little bit, but I think I've decreased it way too much the way it is now.

      <h2>Meetings</h2>
      <p>I attended both WolverineSoft meetings this week.
      I spent about 2 hours in the first one, and 3 in the second. 
      In the meetings we discussed narrative and drafted some potential voice lines.
      I also played a bit of Wargroove in the second meeting to further look at ways the music fits in the game (and for fun :)).
