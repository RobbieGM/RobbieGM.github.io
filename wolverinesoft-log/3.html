      <h1>Week 3: Wizard Attack, Beginnings of a Main Theme</h1>
      <h2>Wizard Attack</h2>
      <p>
        I was assigned the wizard cast and hit sound effects. Unfortunately I didn't (and still don't) know what the wizard looks like in-game so I sort of went in blind.
        I did a bit of research on magical sound effect design, primarily by watching YouTube videos. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHbSUf1aKB4">This one</a> was by far the most helpful. I then decided on making the wizard's magic fire-themed, so I gathered a bunch of sound effects from freesound.org including a sparkler, a wet towel on a hot plate, a large house fire, a small campfire, and some flaming stick whooshes. After a few hours of fiddly editing, I managed to turn this into what you hear below.

      <p>
        It seems likely that this will be too bassy or dramatic within the context of the game, but I don't know yet until it's implemented.
        If that turns out to be the case, maybe I can reuse these effects for the archmage champion character, who is more powerful.
      </p>
      <h2>Main Theme</h2>
      <p>
        This is where I spent most of my time; probably the better part of 2 days but I'll conservatively estimate 10 hours.
        I wasn't even officially assigned this, but I did it because I wanted to have a main theme in the style of Wargroove's main theme.
        Wargroove's main theme starts out with an independent main theme and then incorporates themes from every faction.
        I wanted to do the exact same thing.
        What I have so far is an independent main theme, and a transition section to the theme that will belong to the Asian-themed faction.
        For this I'm planning to use a koto and whistle to help give it a distinct sound.
        These two instruments can already be heard in the below file.
        The other two factions I'll need themes are are a Mediterranean-themed faction and a European-themed faction.
        I'm thinking of using an oud/bouzouki and tablas for the Mediterranean faction, if I can find samples for that, and probably switch key to something <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=th0LBiIRQbA&si=uuKwsOgPPgvOGpVI&t=54">like this</a>.
        For the European-themed faction I think just putting brass instruments front and center should be plenty.

      <p>My only concerns are that maybe the repetition at 0:20 isn't necessary or that the transition at 0:40 is not smooth enough.</p>
      <h2>Meetings</h2>
      <p>I attended both WolverineSoft meetings this week, one of which was virtual.
      These totaled about 2 hours each.
      During the first meeting we went over making WWise events.
      Unfortunately WWise does not work on my computer, so I did not do that part but attended the meeting anyway.
      In the second meeting, we discussed champion music assignments some more, but did not decide finally on who was doing what.
      We also talked about doing Wargroove play sessions to further immerse ourselves in the game.
      I did not end up playing any Wargroove in these two weeks, though.</p>
      <h2>Time Commitment Breakdown</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wizard attack cast &amp; wizard attack hit sounds: 4 hours</li>
        <li>Main theme: 10 hours</li>
        <li>WolverineSoft meetings and Discord communication: 4 hours</li>
        <li>Blog post writing: 1 hour</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Total: 19 hours</b></p>
